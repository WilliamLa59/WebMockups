# Blogr Landing Page

A junior Challange on FrontEnd Mentor with all assets are provided. Found Here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP

The goal for this project is to practice creating React components as well as becoming more comfortable with CSS Flex and Grid. I'll also be learning how to use a CSS preprocessor and a UI Framework in conjunction with React(both are still to be determined).

### CSS preprocessor Options

- SASS 
- ~~~LESS
- ~~~Stylus

### UI Framework Options

- ~~~Material UI
- Chakra UI 
- ~~~React-Bootstrap
