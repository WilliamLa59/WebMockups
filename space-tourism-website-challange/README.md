# Space Tourism Website

This project was done as a challenge on Frontend Mentor.

Challange can be found here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3

I created this in React, and was mainly practice for the utilization of Components and Hooks as well as general practice for HTML and CSS.

  Things I did wrong:

  - Crew page has multiple different states for things like crew name, role, and bio. (Fixed this in later components by using state objects)
  - The CSS is all in one file.(Should learn a CSS compiler for the future. navigating through the CSS file was a nightmare.)
  - Using float most of the time. fine at certain points but finicky to work with. (Learned to use flex and flex-direction in the later stages of development, way easier).
  - Uniformity in CSS, units are all over the place. Started with em, moved to %s, then ended with mostly rem. (pick one unit and stick with it)
